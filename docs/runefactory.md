An app version of [Recipe Finder](recipefinder.md) with more features.

## Period
September 2015

## Tech Stack
Android Studio (Java)

## Motivation
After creating Recipe Finder, I found it troublesome having to use a PC to use the program. So I started thinking about making a mobile app instead, since a handphone is much portable and easily accessible.

Since I was using an Android phone, I started learning how to use Android Studio to create my first mobile app.

I had originally wanted to stop at just the recipe finder feature, but I ended up adding more features to it when I thought about the other stuff that could help me while playing the game.

## Details

Other than the Recipe Finder, I added new features such as Maps, Materials, Town Events and Villager Preferences.

### Recipe Finder
![rf6](/img/rf6.gif)
Search by the ingredient name to get the most profitable dishes sorted in descending order.

### Materials
![rf2](/img/rf2.gif)
I created this feature to quickly check what effects each material will give when used for upgrading weapons. I also used certain keywords related to stats to quickly sort the list according to that keyword.

E.g. I search "ATK" to sort the list of materials which provide a boost in the attack stats in descending order.

### Maps
![rf3](/img/rf3.gif)
This page lists all the maps and which monsters can be found in each area.

![rf4](/img/rf4.gif)
The searched words in this page are also highlighted for easier identification as this page can be used for finding where map and area a specific monster will appear in.

### Town Events

Checkboxes are used to keep track of the town events that have been viewed before. Clicking into them provides more information of the event.
