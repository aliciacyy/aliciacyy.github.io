A web game for my friends' birthdays.

(Yes, I deliberately spelt Pokemon wrongly since it is based off that.)

## Period
December 2013

## Tech Stack
WAMP, MySQL, PHP, HTML, CSS

## Motivation
I had this idea of making a simple turn based kind of game like Pokemon. But due to examinations and insufficient time to create a more complicated game, I decided to just make the game with the tech stack that I had recently learnt for a univeristy module in that semester to save time.

## Details
MySQL database was used to store information of the Pokemon such as their HP, etc.

The whole game was very simple. The Pokemon for my friends were already pre-determined and they will be tasked to win 3 battles.

Like a Pokemon game, the Pokemon can use 1 of 4 different moves for each turn, and the goal is to reduce the opponent's Pokemon's HP to 0.

So after 3 battles, my friends were rewarded with a congratulations screen.
