Generating my profile page using a static site generator.

## Period
August 2018

## Tech Stack
Docusaurus, React, CSS, Markdown, Github

## Motivation
The idea came about when I chanced upon an article talking about static site generators. The article mentioned Docusaurus, so I decided to try it out by trying to create my own humble webpage. Thus, that was how this webpage was born.

## Details
Installing and setting up Docusaurus was straightforward as they had a clear documentation that was simple to follow.
All the pages in this Projects section were generated from Markdown pages, so adding a page was as simple as creating a new Markdown page and adding the ID to the sidebars.json.

For the index page, I was surprised that all the elements on the page were actually components that were created and inserted using React.
I am still not proficient in React yet, but I managed to create my own components along with the CSS so that I need not create a new index page from scratch.
