A simple and short RPG game for a friend's birthday.

## Period

## Tech Stack
RPG Maker MV Ace

## Motivation
Being a person who enjoys playing games, I have always thought of trying to create my own game. I wanted to learn how to make a game in a short period of time for my friend's birthday, so I discovered RPG Maker.

Though this project did not involve any programming, it was an interesting project that tested more on my creativity and design skills.

## Details

In this game, the player will explore the map and gain enough levels to be able to defeat the final boss.

This program makes it quite simple to create games through their user interface. Creating map layouts is as simple as dragging and dropping, but the challenge was more on how to create a map that is not too boring and straightforward.

The program also allowed me to make my own custom cutscenes in the form of putting the actions in a sequence while allowing loops, branches, etc.

The battle system is also included in RPG Marker and all the values can be customized. For example, I introduced "Bowling Balls" as an enemy type.
